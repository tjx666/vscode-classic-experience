Thank you üåπ

## Features

Seamlessly restore the familiar VSCode keybindings in Cursor with a single installation. This extension brings back the keyboard shortcuts you know and love, enhancing your coding experience without any additional configuration.

This extension will not modify any of your Cursor settings or local application files. It simply removes certain Cursor shortcuts and restores the original VSCode shortcuts using the extension API. There's no hidden magic involved. If you ever wish to revert to Cursor's original shortcuts, you can easily do so by disabling or uninstalling this extension.

Key improvements:

- Removes shortcuts prefixed with `‚åò + R`
- Restores the familiar `‚åò + K` prefixed shortcuts from VSCode
- Adjusts frequently used shortcuts modified by Cursor:
  - `‚åò + K`: Restored as VSCode's prefix shortcut (previously "Open Edit" in Cursor, now `‚åò + E`)
  - `‚åò + L`: Restored as "Expand Line Selection" (previously "Open New Chat" in Cursor, now `‚åò + ]`)
  - `‚áß + ‚åò + L`: Restored as "Select All Occurrences of Find Match" (previously "Insert Selection Into Chat" in Cursor, now `‚å• + ‚áß + ]`)
  - `‚áß + ‚åò + K`: Restored as "Delete Line" (previously "[Add to Edit](https://docs.cursor.com/context/%40-symbols/%40-code#from-the-editor), just add current selection to composer"). I didn't add a new shortcut for `Add to Edit`, custom it as you like.
  - You can use `‚áß + ‚åò + K` to clear terminal in Cursor, because you can't make `‚åò + K` to clear terminal work in Cursor.
- `.cursor/mcp.json` json validate schema

### How to bring back the original vscode activity bar and side bar layout

just like you see in above screenshot, only need add following settings to your `settings.json`

```jsonc
{
  // don't forget to restart to take effect
  "workbench.activityBar.orientation": "vertical",
}
```

### How to use the `.cursor/mcp.json` without install this extension

just add following settings to your `settings.json`

```jsonc
{
  "json.schemas": [
    {
      "fileMatch": [".cursor/mcp.json"],
      "url": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tjx666/vscode-classic-experience/refs/heads/main/schemas/mcp.schema.json",
    },
  ],
}
```

## Alternatives

While you can restore the `‚åò + K` keybinding prefix by changing the `workbench.action.keychord.leader` to `‚åò + K`, this approach has some drawbacks:

1. It adds numerous keybindings to your `keybindings.json`, making it harder to manage.
2. It doesn't address other frequently used keybindings modified by Cursor, such as `‚åò + L`.

This extension provides a more comprehensive and manageable solution to restore VSCode-like keybindings in Cursor.

## Windows and Linux

As this extension has been primarily developed and tested on macOS, compatibility with Windows and Linux systems has not been thoroughly verified. However, it is expected that most keybindings should work across platforms. If you encounter any issues or discrepancies on Windows or Linux, please don't hesitate to open an issue or submit a pull request. Your feedback and contributions are greatly appreciated to help improve cross-platform compatibility.
